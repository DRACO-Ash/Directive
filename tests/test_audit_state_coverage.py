"""Which writers reach `old_state` and `new_state`, and under which rule.

Two documents make a coverage claim about this and both got it wrong before this module
existed. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` said `check_state` enforced the closed vocabulary on every
route the application serves, and `records.check_state` said no route reached those fields
without passing through it. The sign-in refusal path falsifies both: it composes a
collapsed-count marker server-side and writes it straight to the chain, under the audit
boundary's character rule alone.

The claim is now bounded and the bound is held here: every REGISTER writer goes through the
vocabulary, the refusal path is the one declared exception, and it carries no caller value.
